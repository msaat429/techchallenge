### Summary

> This repository contains a nodejs Mock JSON server. 
> 
> File db.json holds a small amount of **relational** json data.
> To start the server, check out the available scripts in the package.json file.

### Instructions 

> 1. Create a web application (in either javascript or python, your choice) that querys data from this backend server. The web app should look as close to the provided designs as possible. Create a new GitHub repository in your personal GitHub account for this project.

> 2. You will need to clone this repo and run it in your local dev environment. No code needs to be added to the backend server.
>
> 3. The 3 prompts you will need to query for are:
> - Return all the users found on the server
> - Return all orders found on the server
> - Return only the orders from the user Jane Doe
>
> 4. You will need to authenticate your requests with this Bearer key ``` "as33dienWJawEgm!@44SDeuasrl48zdsl!_" ```
>
> 5. Once completed, email mpickett@shinesolar.com with a link to your newly created repository. I will clone your repo and test for completion on the same backend server. Please include in your submission if you are applying for an internship or full-time position and your available start date.
